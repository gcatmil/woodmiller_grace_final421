    <h2 class="hidden">About</h2>
    <p class="text_column">The research that I have conducted thus far has proven to be successful in theory. The research? I believe that I have solved cancer by using a method of targetted cell freezing and then age reversal using injected retinoids that are not harmful when present in the body. This theory has been so far simulated by the French Medical Oncology Board and the greater medical community is discussing it, but it has yet to officially undergo trialing. <br><br> It has been mentioned that the process for trialing is being discussed, and phase 1 could begin in 2022. However I have no further confirmations aside from the theory being successful. <br><br><hom>Updated 8.23.21. Please check back later for more updates.</hom></p>
    <p class="text_column"> The reason why I decided to research cancer is because of my cousin, Chloe. She is 8 years old. She has unfortunately started to develop Leukemia after a false positive screening that has caused significant health decline. I am helping that I can reduce her pain as much as possible and avoid the worst outcome. She is very smart and an inspiration in my life that has caused me to reach as far as I have today. </p>
		
    <p class="text_column">A different project that I have begun researching is in all-in-one hair product that combines hyaluronic acids, essential oils, and retinoids to increase moisture absorption and promote hair growth. So far, it seems like will need to be a two-part process as a shampoo and conditioner with hyaluronic acid is beneficial but subject to criticism due to misuse. Conditioner with the acids will absolutely need a moisture-intense oil after, but that can be an ethical issue because it would "imply" consumers need to buy a third product. <br> <br>
		
	There are no further research projects for now as I am very busy, but I am thinking of opening up an email to get input on what types of research I should pursue next. Continuing humanitarian and philanthropic topics seems to be the best way to put my skills to use, but there are also a lot of creative ways to combat world issues. One of my other ideas was to create a plant overgrowth toxin that increases grow time by 200%. This could allow us to refurbish the world with trees and nature that is essential in reducing greenhouse gases and providing us fresh oxygen. </p>

      <p class="bro">Now that we'e discussed by research, I implore you to get involved! How can you start? Well, anyone can create a hypothesis and undergo a testing process to "create" or "prove" a truth, but it is usually hard to stick with that process. I suggest starting slow with plant-based theory or something easy in the kitchen! <br>A great example that my mother and I did was eggs vs baking powder: which one was the better binding agent? What IS a binding agent? Does baking soda work too?</p>
