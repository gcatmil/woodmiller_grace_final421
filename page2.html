    <h2 class="hidden">About</h2>
    <p class="text_column">The inventions I have include my Rubriks robot and perhaps method of defeating cancer, but I have many differing ideas on new inventions and what they could be. I want to develop more robots and provide open source code so that all of my readers have a chance to get started on their own Rubriks solver. My robot also makes me meals and can clean around the house, althoughnot as efficiently as I would like him to be able. </p>
    <p class="text_column">Some other inventions I have in mind are creating robot animals, developing the rest of this website, and I want to work on cars more often. While that wouldn't necessarily be invention, working on arduous mechanical machines like that really help my creative juices get flowing.  </p>
    <p class="text_column">My work-in-progress as mentioned is free open-source doing. A repository will be held on GitHub so that anyone can download the code from my robots to make their very own unique robot. In the future, I will add a place to upload peoples robots or demonstrate what they do, and I can hopefully hold a contest by month to encite improvemment on robots!</p>
